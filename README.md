# CS419-RecommenderSystem
Recommender System implemented in Python by implementing mathematical models like User Based Similarity Model, Item Based Similarity Model, Statistical Baseline Model &amp; Gradient Descent Baseline Model

## Goals Of The Project:
<p>The primary goal of this project is to estimate the ratings on 2 DataSets: MovieLens and Yelp. The secondary goal is to compare different methodologies for this regression project.</p>
<p>For Yelp DataSet, this involves predicting rating values of businesses that users have not visited before based on their historical rating records and measuring the difference between the predicted and actual values of this rating.</p>
<p>For MovieLens DataSet, this involves predicting rating values of movies that users have not seen before based on their historical rating records and measuring the difference between the predicted and actual values of this rating.</p>
<p>Finally, comparing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for different methodologies gaining in knowledge of comparison between the respective methodologies..</p>
